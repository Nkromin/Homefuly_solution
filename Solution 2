Problem Statement 2 -
            Consider a staircase of size :

                 #
                ##
               ###
              ####
              Observe that its base and height are both equal to n, and the image is drawn using # symbols and spaces. The last line is not preceded by any spaces.

              Write a program that prints a staircase of size n.

              Input Format

               A single integer, n , denoting the size of the staircase.

               Output Format

               Print a staircase of size n using # symbols and spaces.

               Note: The last line must have 0 spaces in it.

               Sample Input

               6

               Sample Output

                          #
