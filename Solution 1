Problem Statement - 
Write the output of the following problem and explain your output:


var fullname = 'John Doe';
var obj = {
   fullname: 'Colin Ihrig',
   prop: {
      fullname: 'Aurelio De Rosa',
      getFullname: function() {
         return this.fullname;
      }
   }
};

console.log(obj.prop.getFullname());

var test = obj.prop.getFullname;

console.log(test());

Solution-
output:
       Aurelio De Rosa
       John Doe
 Explaination - In the "console.log(obj.prop.getFullname())" statement getFullname is invoked and returns the fullname that is currently 
                 pointed by "this". In this case this points towards fullname of prop ie Aurelio De Rosa (function local to prop).
                 
                In second Output, John Doe is printed because when getfullname() is assigned to test, the parameter which "this" is pointing
                now is global object which in this case happens to be "fullname(John Doe)".
 
                This concludes the explaination.
